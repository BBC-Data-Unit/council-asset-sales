# Schools, care homes and sports clubs sold off to pay spiralling council debt

Communities across the UK are paying for spiralling levels of council borrowing with a fire sale of publicly owned facilities, a [BBC study has found](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq87497v8ypo).

## Methodology

We extracted debt data from the borrowing and investment live tables (Q4 2024 to 2025) by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

We summed all the borrowing categories listed to get our “total amassed debt” figure.

One of the most commonly used metrics in reports of council debt is the yearly amount an authority spends in servicing borrowing as a proportion of its “core spending power”. Core spending power is a [measure of the resources available to local authorities to fund services](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/core-spending-power-final-local-government-finance-settlement-2023-to-2024/explanatory-note-on-core-spending-power). 

However, we found measuring debt against core spending power was problematic. 

This is partly because of self-financing laws brought in under the Localism Act in 2012, which allowed many councils to effectively buy their existing social housing stock out of the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. 

This enabled some to keep all of the rent received from their social housing stock but also required them to take on a set amount of debt relating to the size of their stock. This debt is included in the “total amassed debt” in Oflog’s official figures.

However, some councils have argued that core spending power does not include any of the income they receive from social housing and is therefore a misleading metric. Income from commercial investments is also not included in core spending power. 

When we took guidance from MHCLG, we found the department was in the process of revising this measure after receiving representations from councils. 

For instance, North East Derbyshire Council told us: “The HRA (Housing Revenue Account) debt makes up 95% of the Council’s total debt with less than only £7m relating to the general fund. This is not recognised in the publicly available measure of debt v net revenue spend, with revenue spend only taking into account general fund expenditure. If the HRA debt is separated out then our % debt to NRE on the General Fund is negligible.”
